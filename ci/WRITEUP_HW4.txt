All tests have been done using Chrome browser version: 43.0.2357.130

_For customer-side, if you don't want to sign up and have your own credential, you can use these account:
username: jdoe, pass: 123
username: nstamp, pass: 123

Database:
I have included the mydatabase.sql file along with HW2 submission that shows clearly field names, types, and sizes. Please refer to that file for database

Database notes:
I have decided that in my database, a product can be in multiple categories and a category can have multiple products (that's why I created an extra table product_and_category).
Also, I decided to have a special sale event can be applied to multiple products, but a product can have ONLY 1 special sale event (UNIQUE constrain in database). 

There is a customer table to store customer's info. There is "shopping_cart" table to store shopping cart of user who logs in and then logs out without placing order.

There is orders table to store all orders and order_items table to store all items purchased in 1 order.

_Feature on shopping cart:
Customer can see my products and add to his/her cart without logging in. However, when they want to check out, they will be prompted to log in.
>>>If they already have some products in their cart in prior log-in, those product will be merged with the ones currently in the cart. For example, if the same product
>>>is in the cart and the database, then quantity will be increased accordingly. Else, shopping cart will be added new products.

Shopping cart won't be saved if customer does NOT log in and close browser.
